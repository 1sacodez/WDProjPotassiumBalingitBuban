<u> Description of Website: </u>

    KKQuiz! is a fun and interactive website to quiz you on how well you know selected students of 9-Potassium Batch 2029!

    With different sets of multiple-choice questions, time limits ranging from 15 seconds to 30, and a silly banana watching over you in the corner (his name's Gary), the pressure's on as you go about the quiz and test your Knowledge on K-2029! Be prepared, because the questions could be as easy as their age or their favorite color, or as difficult as—!..... Oh, what, you thought we were gonna spill? Haha!

    Now go ahead! Choose your minion, start the quiz, and see... how much do you really know?

    And who knows? Maybe, Gary'll have for you a little surprise somewhere in between...

<u> Description on how JS will be incorporated in our website: </u>

    As our website is a quiz/game-style one, every question is to have a correct answer, and every answer should be counted of a point. We envision that JS will be incorporated as the game progresses, counting the number of right or wrong answers of the player. Once the game is finished, it will tally and summarize the results, with every range of values/percentages also having an assigned and equivalent text result. And in the end, the player should be able to truly answer, how well really do they know that Minion?
